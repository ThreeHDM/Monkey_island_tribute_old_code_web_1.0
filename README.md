# Old Monkey Island tribute website I created in my youth

While I was making backups of old CDs I found this old website I created using Microsoft Frontpage back in 2005~9 (I don't rememeber the exact date).

The final version got lost and this is all is left.

I decided to upload it just for fun.

Also to show my love for web development and, of course, my love for the Monkey Island franchise.

## How to properly live the experience (lol)

This site was created using Microsoft Frontpage so.. as hard as it sounds... it runs properly on IE.

Here is the link to view it:

Enjoy!

## Notes

I removed the downloads section and other non important files.

Legal Disclaimer: I made this tribute site just for fun and with no commercial agenda. It was never online.
