# Old Monkey Island tribute website I created in my youth

While I was making backups of old CDs I found this old website I created using Microsoft Frontpage back in 2005~9 (I don't rememeber the exact date).

The final version got lost and this is all is left.

I decided to upload it just for fun.

Also to show my love for web development and, of course, my love for the Monkey Island franchise.

## How to properly live the experience (lol)

This site was created using Microsoft Frontpage so.. as hard as it sounds... it runs properly on IE.

[Here is the link to view it](https://threehdm.github.io/Monkey_island_tribute_old_code_web_1.0/pagina%20inicio.htm) 

Enjoy!

## Notes

I removed the downloads section and other non important files.

Legal Disclaimer: I made this tribute site just for fun and with no commercial agenda. It was never online.
